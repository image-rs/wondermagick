// You know what would be a cool optimization for decoding process?
// Using the image thumbnail from the Exif metadata, when it's present.
// Many JPEG images have it; other formats can contain it as well.
// That way you don't even have to decode the full-size image!
// You can dump it from a JPEG that has one like this:
// $ exiftool -b -ThumbnailImage image.jpg > ~/thumb.jpg
// It saves so much time! Every competent thumbnailer uses it!
//
// But imagemagick is not a competent thumbnailer.
// Imagemagick not only ignores it, it does something far worse:
// It keeps the old thumbnail even after modifying the image.
// Making the embedded thumbnail WRONG.
//
// Not only does it not make use of the thumbnail that someone
// has already spent network bandwidth and storage on,
// but it also breaks any other program making use of it,
// by keeping the old thumbnail around
// even when it doesn't match the image anymore.
//
// This is completely wrong behavior no matter how you look at it.
// But that's what imagemagick does and what we must do as well.
// Until we decide enough is enough and some bugs aren't worth
// being compatible with, but that day is not today.
